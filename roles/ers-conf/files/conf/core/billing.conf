# parameter specifies the file containing the textual template for the topup
# notification.  It may contain variables delimited by dollar '$' signs.

# Valid variables are:
# $account_id$          - Main account id for the topup
# $account_id2$         - Secondary account id for the topup
# $amount$              - Amount topped up
# $reference$           - Unique reference for the topup
# $account_description$ - Description of account (from database)
# $balance$             - Balance after topup formatted in natural reading
# 			  format ("$15,75", "100 Kr" etc)
# $disposable$          - Disposable credit on account after topup in natural
# 			  reading format

# If true (default) ignore reference in transactions when doing reverse topup

# 
# If false, a new (more robust) strategy for generating reference numbers is used
#    This relies on a separate one-row table that keeps the reference as a simulated sequence (as per MySQL recommendation)
# THIS IS AN UN-TESTED AND UNSUPPORTED FEATURE, DON'T TURN THIS ON FOR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!!
#     
# If true (default), the old reference generation will be used, which at startup selects the highest reference in the db and then counts upwards
# Note: the new reference generation relies on the existence of the transaction_counter table  
#    
# legacy_reference_generation=false

# If using the new reference generation, a prefix can be set which will be prepended to all references (default this is set to "BB")
# This is useful if there are multiple billing systems or to be able to distinguish between multiple systems or older versions
# 
# transaction_reference_prefix=BB

# The length of transaction references (excluding any prefix) default is 10 and this was previously hardcoded
